# Wikipedia-Crawler
This code will crawl Wikipedia pages until it finds a destination page.

Execute Wikipedia_crawler.py to run the program.

This will fetch a random wikipedia page and start exploring the first link of all the pages until
it finds a specific page or if it is stuck in a loop of pages
